# DictTest

Example of making a root dictionary two different ways, one using rootcling and the other using genreflex.
The examples are designed to be run on a machine that can see:
```
/cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org/
```

For historical reasons building dictionaries using rootcling is done using a cmake based build system
while building dictionaries using genreflex is done using an scons based build system.   The source
code is in a GitHub repository; it contains the files to control both the cmake builds and the scons
builds; each build systems ignore the control files for the other build system.

## Using rootcling via cmake

In clean working directory, with a clean environment
```bash
source /cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org/setupmu2e-art.sh
git clone https://github.com/kutschke/DictTest.git
setup -B cmake v3_22_0
setup -B root v6_24_06b -q+e20:+p399:+prof
mkdir dicttest_profile
cd dicttest_profile
cmake ../DictTest  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j 1 VERBOSE=1 >& build.log
```

Now look at the rootmap file to find the result:
```
grep header lib/libGeneral.rootmap
```

You can inspect the build.log file to find the rootcling command that was generated by cmake.

## Using genreflex via scons via muse

In clean working directory, with a clean environment
```bash
source /cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org/setupmu2e-art.sh
git clone https://github.com/kutschke/DictTest.git
muse setup -1 -q p020
muse build -j 1 >& build.log
```

Now look at the rootmap file to find the result:
```
grep header build/sl7-prof-e20-p020/DictTest/lib/libdicttestGeneral_dict.rootmap
```

You can inspect the build.log file to the find the genreflex command that was generated by
the Mu2e scons helper scripts.

### About Muse

Muse is a thin layer on top of scons.  The command
```muse setup -q p020``` says to setup the environment using:
```/cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org/DataFiles/Muse/p020``` .
The -1 argument is not important for this example - it says that include
directives in code must have a leading "Package/" or the compiler won't find
the includes.

The command ```muse build -j 1``` does book keeping, calls:
```
scons -C $MUSE_WORK_DIR -f $MUSE_DIR/python/SConstruct "$@"
```
and does a little more bookkeeping.  The combination of Muse and the SConstruct
file will inspect the tree rooted at the working directory for work to do and will
then do it.
